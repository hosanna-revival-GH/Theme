We believe in the absolute authority of Jesus, and we therefore affirm what he affirmed. <\/p><p>A study of the four gospel accounts in Scripture reveals Jesus affirmed the whole of the Old Testament (Matthew 5:17-18). He affirmed it as a reliable record of history (cf. Matthew 10:15; 19:3-5; 12:40; 24:38-39) and prophetic accuracy (Matthew 26:54). He affirmed it as sufficient (Luke 16:31), unified (Luke 24:27,44), without error (Matthew 22:29; John 17:17), infallible (John 10:35), and authoritative (Matthew 21:13, 16, 42). History also shows that first century Jews did not consider the Apocryphal writings to be canonical Scripture, and neither did Jesus.

Adam and Eve were created holy and perfectly happy in God’s creation, but that perfect harmony with God was destroyed and the earth was cursed as a result of their sin. <\/p><p><strong>The Account of Israel: <\/strong>The story of Israel is a fairly similar narrative. God saves Abraham’s descendants from Egyptian slavery and exile and leads them into a lush, green land he promised to Abraham hundreds of years earlier. But just like Adam, the children of Israel rebelled against God and were exiled from the Promised Land. <\/p><p><strong>How it Ends:<\/strong> The Old Testament ends with the children of Israel—Abraham’s descendants—returning to the Promised Land, but it is no longer the paradise it once was. They are still in exile under foreign rule. There is conflict and pain. The weight of the curse still remained, but so did the promise of God to send a Savior—the Messiah—to break this curse and put an end to suffering once and for all.

Instead, he had come for a much greater purpose: to break the curse of sin.

If you&rsquo;re using a lighter color for the background, you might have to paint two coats before you get to your design.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you paint the &ldquo;creases&rdquo; of your journal, make sure to not let paint glob in the crease.

rooted in Scripture and aim to:<\/p><p><strong>Point the reader to Jesus.<\/strong>  The Bible is not about us—it’s all about Jesus and His message for us, namely, the gospel.  Our desire for each devotional is that every reader would love Jesus more as a result of having read it.<\/p><p><strong>Practically apply to the Christian life.  <\/strong>There are no Christian superstars.  We’re ordinary people serving an extraordinary God.  Our goal for each devotional is that it would deepen the reader’s understanding of Christian truth as it is taught in the Scriptures, and how we can apply it to everyday life.<\/p><p><strong>Stand firmly on the Word of God.<\/strong>  The Bible is the very Word of God.  God has chosen to reveal Himself to us through His Word, and our prayer for each devotional is that they would be deeply rooted in Scripture and always point the reader to the Bible.  If you can read our devotional without your Bible in hand, we have not accomplished our mission.<\/p><p><strong>What types of devotionals and books is Hosanna Revival <\/strong><em><strong>not<\/strong><\/em><strong> interested in?<br\/><\/strong>- Religious “self-help”

To Pursue Intimacy with God","text":"<p>We often think of prayer as a good way to get what we want from God. A closer look at Scripture, however, reveals that as we grow in the Lord, we understand that prayer is not so much about getting something <em>from<\/em> God, but rather getting more <em>of<\/em> God. Prayer is communion with God! It is an intimate time of communing with our Father in heaven. When you think of a best friend or even a really good friend, you probably think of someone you speak to often. For some of us, it’s someone we speak to every single day, and that makes sense—you can’t be close to someone you never speak to. God is our Father, and he loves to hear from his children.<\/p><p>In Psalm 141:2 the psalmist writes, “Let my prayer be counted as incense before you.” In Revelation 5:8 and Revelation 8:5, we see that God truly does keep every prayer of his children in bowls—they are a sweet-smelling incense to him. Billions of prayers, prayed throughout every century since the dawn of time are kept and treasured by God our Father. <\/p><p>If you feel distant from God, or are uncomfortable speaking to him with such closeness, start small. Pray simple prayers (use the tips included at the end of this toolkit). Read his Word to learn more about his character and his loving heart for you. He wants to hear from you, and the more you speak to him, the more you will grow to love and trust him.<\/p>"}},"5b908ee0-16ab-4f53-b750-e8843a80d687":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"2.

John Piper once said, “God is always doing 10,000 things in your life, and you may be aware of three of them.” <\/p><p>When you pray consistently, you will be more perceptive of God moving in your life. If you have prayed for opportunities to share Jesus with a friend who doesn’t know him, you will be more likely to notice when God answers those prayers than if you hadn’t prayed. God may have given you those opportunities before, but because you’re praying about it, you’ll be more aware of God’s answers to those prayers. If you never took your requests to God in prayer, you might miss God’s movement in your life—even though he is certainly moving! It’s too easy for us to forget God’s loving heart for us and that he is working all things together for his glory and our good. <\/p><p>Trusting God with your prayers also deepens your trust, as you will see God prove himself faithful time and time again. God has always been faithful, but when we’re not spending time in prayer, we may miss his kind acts of faithfulness in our lives. God is faithful to provide for our needs and to answer our prayers.

To begin this process, qualified biblical scholars were needed to interpret the meaning of the original text and to check it against our base English translation. In order to guard against personal and theological biases, the scholars needed to represent a diverse group of evangelicals who would employ the best exegetical tools. Then to work alongside the scholars, skilled English stylists were needed to shape the text into clear, contemporary English.<\/p><p>With these concerns in mind, the Bible Translation Committee recruited teams of scholars that represented a broad spectrum of denominations, theological perspectives, and backgrounds within the worldwide evangelical community. Each book of the Bible was assigned to three different scholars with proven expertise in the book or group of books to be reviewed. Each of these scholars made a thorough review of a base translation and submitted suggested revisions to the appropriate Senior Translator. The Senior Translator then reviewed and summarized these suggestions and proposed a first-draft revision of the base text. This draft served as the basis for several additional phases of exegetical and stylistic committee review. Then the Bible Translation Committee jointly reviewed and approved every verse of the final translation.<\/p><p>Throughout the translation and editing process, the Senior Translators and their scholar teams were given a chance to review the editing done by the team of stylists. This ensured that exegetical errors would not be introduced late in the process and that the entire Bible Translation Committee was happy with the final result. By choosing a team of qualified scholars and skilled stylists and by setting up a process that allowed their interaction throughout the process, the New Living Translation has been refined to preserve the essential formal elements of the original biblical texts, while also creating a clear, understandable English text.<\/p>","align_text":"left","narrow_column":true,"enlarge_text":false,"space_above":0,"space_below":75}},"69b21e99-de8d-4155-a110-b6fee4984689":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"css-id":"","css-class":"","color_bg":"#ffffff","color_text":"#000000","title":"Endorsements","text":"<p>“The NLT was put together by a dream team of scholars and linguists and gives us a Bible that is thoroughly reliable and eminently readable.

When it came to wanting a 17-Month or 12-Month Planner, 60% of you said 12-Month, and 40% said 17-Month. Our 12-Month gals expressed sadness that 5 of the 17 months would go unused, whether it was the first 5 months before starting in January or the last 5 months when you’d buy a new Hosanna planner.<\/p><p>🤔 THE DIGEST: We sat down with this data and thought through our options. For years we’ve provided a 17-Month Planner running from August-December. Even when 60% of you prefer a planner running Jan-Dec, 40% of you still enjoy an academic planner. We wanted to serve all of you well.<\/p><p>💡 THE SOLUTION: We decided to keep our planners 17-Month Planners so that we could serve all of you well.

In other words, culture wants to remind women, “<em>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder!<\/em> So don’t let some beholders get you down, <em>you<\/em> are the true and only important beholder!” This sentiment sounds empowering at first glance, but the results don’t corroborate. Since this study in 2016, the number of voices chanting womens’ empowerment have grown, and yet so has the number of women who hate the way they look and even hate themselves. Maybe it's time women turn to the Scriptures for their answers instead of their favorite celebrities.\"<br\/><br\/><em>- Paige Stitt McBride, author<\/em><\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","layout":"left"}},"11bbe30b-24ac-48fd-bed1-a48ff35e542e":{"type":"single-button","settings":{"alignment":"center","space_above":30,"space_below":30,"button_text":"buy now","button_link":"shopify:\/\/products\/devotional-beauty-not-beheld","button_size":"huge"}},"2e296a17-4055-45c8-825f-2cf5b0087bc9":{"type":"parallax-hero","settings":{"parallax":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Beauty-Not-Beheld-Devotional-Hosanna-Revival-Floral-Nest-183.jpg","focal_point":"center center","section_height":"450px","title":"BONUS CONTENT","title_size":72,"subheading":"For \"Beauty Not Beheld\"","link":"","link_text":"","color_accent":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_align":"vertical-center horizontal-center"}},"c22e5661-6b95-417c-8494-68791bee4a1d":{"type":"text-and-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Artboard_2_copy_11.png","image_width":500,"subtitle":"Study Tools","title":"New to the Bible?","text":"<p>Are you new to reading the Bible?

When she’s not marveling at God’s grace and goodness, succumbing to her sweet tooth, or showing you her impressive collection of sea urchin shells, you’ll find her enjoying the beautiful Cape with her loved ones. <em>Unfold: Discerning the Thoughts and Intentions of the Heart<\/em> is Liesl’s first published devotional.<\/p>","button_label":"FOLLOW LIESL","button_link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/liesllamprecht\/","layout":"right"}},"b2ab1411-a116-4f5d-99fa-a83105a2b5de":{"type":"text-and-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/UnfoldLibraryImages_05.png","image_width":500,"subtitle":"Meet the Author","title":"Liesl's Story","text":"<p>Growing up in the church, I wholeheartedly believed that Jesus died on the cross for my sins and that salvation is a gift that cannot be earned. But when I continued reading the rest of the New Testament’s teachings on the renewed, holy life of a Christian, I felt crushed by how impossible it all seemed. Instead of basking in God’s endless grace and new mercies each morning, I allowed my heart to wallow in sin and condemnation, eventually straying from his ways. You see, the problem was that I thought I had to <em>keep <\/em>my salvation by my own efforts. My relationship with God was dependent on my performance. Thankfully, Jesus shone his light on my heart during my university years, reigniting my faith and fervor with a renewed realization of the meaning of grace. <\/p><p>I wrote <em>Unfold <\/em>with the prayer that it would be a tool to help others channel the heavy feelings of conviction into a hopeful repentance as we rejoice at the foot of the cross. This devotional will show you that you don’t have to strive to live a life that is pleasing to God to keep your place as his child. It is exactly because you are in Christ that you can seek God daily, confess your sins, and trust that he will continue to wash and renew your heart even if you keep messing up. God doesn’t need you to be perfect. He just wants you and your heart.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","layout":"left"}},"fb6feee0-01ff-41a6-8f2e-31a8dcf411b5":{"type":"single-button","settings":{"alignment":"center","space_above":30,"space_below":30,"button_text":"BUY NOW","button_link":"https:\/\/hosannarevival.com\/products\/devotional-unfold","button_size":"huge"}},"6e53320f-36ad-4408-9611-b1503d47df88":{"type":"parallax-hero","settings":{"parallax":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Unfold-HosannaRevival-55.jpg","focal_point":"center center","section_height":"450px","title":"","title_size":72,"subheading":"","link":"https:\/\/hosannarevival.com\/products\/devotional-unfold","link_text":"Shop Unfold","color_accent":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_align":"vertical-center horizontal-center"}},"6531cca0-9668-41bf-8af5-27a60afb5cae":{"type":"single-button","settings":{"alignment":"center","space_above":30,"space_below":30,"button_text":"BACK TO DEVOTIONAL LIBRARY","button_link":"shopify:\/\/pages\/devotionals","button_size":"huge"}},"026e9cb8-c1a8-4f04-978c-20ca314bb3dd":{"type":"featured-collection","settings":{"title":"SHOP ALL DEVOTIONALS","collection":"devotionals","per_row":5,"rows":1,"mobile_scrollable":true,"view_all":true}}},"block_order":["53c7fb6f-2019-41b3-86ae-34836ee315fc","22c4d88f-ae99-4370-a5db-d3283907c21b","0486ffd9-d030-4e90-929d-38e30f091a4b","268d5a38-09d7-4be0-a49b-e8de273c2671","56222c33-230e-4656-ae33-e16da4a028fd","59417076-9649-4117-bd66-7409cc9bfde5","4e58d83f-0f3e-4679-866d-c28dc31de6a7","aa880893-1c1f-4b9c-ba83-4e1cb812b7a9","e9d44258-6884-4998-a5e7-34e79519783a","70aee806-4208-45db-848e-ad356fe5f55d","717a67c6-2b7e-48ce-b85c-558b7f2c3bc5","a7cd86d0-cf1c-4664-8997-b16f42674fea","e5aa9ae5-7e6d-4f99-b0be-9524b54a4b35","657b8777-d51f-410a-8341-dfe3d238f883","b2ab1411-a116-4f5d-99fa-a83105a2b5de","fb6feee0-01ff-41a6-8f2e-31a8dcf411b5","6e53320f-36ad-4408-9611-b1503d47df88","6531cca0-9668-41bf-8af5-27a60afb5cae","026e9cb8-c1a8-4f04-978c-20ca314bb3dd"],"settings":{"page_title_enable":false,"page_content_enable":false}},"page-giveabible-template":{"type":"page-giveabible-template","blocks":{"746f7e04-3e95-40d6-bdf5-4de3089945b7":{"type":"parallax-hero","settings":{"parallax":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Winter-Collection-Styled-at-Home-Leather-Bibles-Hosanna-Revival-029.jpg","focal_point":"center center","section_height":"450px","title":"GIVE A BIBLE","title_size":72,"subheading":"Introducing Give a Bible: Our Bible Donation Initiative","link":"https:\/\/hosannarevival.com\/products\/give-a-bible","link_text":"","color_accent":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_align":"vertical-center horizontal-center"}},"049ffb15-4c08-4855-9c14-7c0c17894122":{"type":"image-hero","disabled":true,"settings":{"parallax":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/BirthdayGiveback_homepage-desktop.png","focal_point":"center center","section_height":"natural","title":"","title_size":72,"subheading":"","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/give-a-bible","link_text":"","color_accent":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_align":"vertical-center horizontal-center"}},"7b1dff19-9c65-4037-a037-46713cfb7f38":{"type":"mobile-hero","disabled":true,"settings":{"parallax":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/BDay-Giveback-Cake-Animation-2.gif","focal_point":"center center","section_height":"natural","title":"","title_size":72,"subheading":"","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/give-a-bible","link_text":"","color_accent":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_align":"vertical-center horizontal-center"}},"537dffae-113a-4aea-bada-91f7d8c9b110":{"type":"mobile-hero","disabled":true,"settings":{"parallax":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/BirthdayGiveback_homepage-mobile.png","focal_point":"center center","section_height":"natural","title":"","title_size":72,"subheading":"","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/give-a-bible","link_text":"","color_accent":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_align":"vertical-center horizontal-center"}},"067ca4b0-d074-4177-9db9-6133eda2eb96":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"css-id":"","css-class":"","color_bg":"#ffffff","color_text":"#000000","title":"Give a Bible: Our Bible  donation initiative","text":"<p><em>Cover the cost to donate a Bible for only $9.99<\/em><\/p>","align_text":"center","narrow_column":true,"enlarge_text":true,"space_above":34,"space_below":34}},"c2392d53-eff4-4b98-bc89-c51afce73fb3":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"css-id":"","css-class":"","color_bg":"#ffffff","color_text":"#000000","title":"","text":"<p>We are excited to provide you with the opportunity to cover the cost of donating a beautiful Hosanna Revival Bible to a selection of local and international partners through our <em>Give a Bible <\/em>initiative.

The nuances of Christianity were confusing and as a teen who had never set foot in a church, I had no idea where to begin. Maybe you’ve walked near to God for a while now, but you long for a fresh perspective; or, perhaps you crave a reintroduction to the one who drew you near in the first place. I’ve been in those places and every spot in between asking myself, “Where do I go from here?”<\/p><p>Jesus is the best place to start. Always. We might never understand the hows or whys about God, but we can always learn <em>who<\/em> he is. God is not far or unknowable, he is someone to meet, and he longs for us to draw closer to him. We have to let go of who God <em>isn’t<\/em> in order to meet him as he truly <em>is<\/em>. So wherever you might be today, let’s start from here, together, and discover the character of God. He is the starting and finish line, and, friend, he wants to run the race with us. <\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","layout":"left"}},"01ec9351-e0a9-497a-b90f-9df5ecf8ba31":{"type":"single-button","settings":{"alignment":"center","space_above":30,"space_below":30,"button_text":"Buy Now","button_link":"https:\/\/hosannarevival.com\/products\/start-from-here","button_size":"huge"}},"d6bfaf4a-9d19-470c-9fbb-d09141c5da06":{"type":"parallax-hero","settings":{"parallax":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Start-From-Here-Devotional-Coffeeshop-Ness-Cannon-Hosanna-Revival-279.jpg","focal_point":"center center","section_height":"450px","title":"","title_size":72,"subheading":"","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/devotional-i-am-not-in-charge","link_text":"shop more from ness cannon","color_accent":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_align":"vertical-center horizontal-center"}},"174ef830-4833-4eb8-bac4-7abbceff89e4":{"type":"single-button","settings":{"alignment":"center","space_above":30,"space_below":30,"button_text":"Back to Devotional Library","button_link":"shopify:\/\/pages\/devotionals","button_size":"huge"}},"e9be531b-cdd4-4763-8697-42b33f3b494f":{"type":"featured-collection","settings":{"title":"Shop All Devotionals","collection":"devotionals","per_row":5,"rows":1,"mobile_scrollable":true,"view_all":true}}},"block_order":["3bc44806-981c-429d-8bc0-0aa25bec2b8a","0b2e83d5-3758-4c30-8d4e-9b6f124b0c5a","1fd68983-7055-4b36-8647-e5b8fc39c873","96d2dfa7-614d-41f3-9521-a9abdc73a403","cca9ec8d-c4d9-4c07-8688-4d25d741e016","3e93705d-b1ac-405a-ac41-43c97f0f2218","66fe7b3f-04df-4f63-8337-712aef41903a","1fb5512f-aeda-4280-809f-38a8b66a5edb","f12f275a-cc2a-4af6-b813-9e333771c13e","333a8993-1038-4efe-b3a0-1016eb26d6c1","497685a0-6e5b-40eb-99a4-a50cd5b51c62","4b467893-622a-4dc8-a2ee-30480ffa66bd","ce9a7414-290c-4126-b4df-d7c1ea5b91f1","1a021cce-9d2e-4bfa-85e4-f4545351d6cc","4a411be2-7894-429c-9f65-89056ad15ac8","01ec9351-e0a9-497a-b90f-9df5ecf8ba31","d6bfaf4a-9d19-470c-9fbb-d09141c5da06","174ef830-4833-4eb8-bac4-7abbceff89e4","e9be531b-cdd4-4763-8697-42b33f3b494f"],"settings":{"page_title_enable":false,"page_content_enable":false}},"page-beautiful-bibles-template":{"type":"page-beautiful-bibles-template","blocks":{"12706c76-a33b-4b31-91a0-3138c5ff3d2e":{"type":"parallax-hero","settings":{"parallax":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Winter-Collection-Styled-at-Home-Leather-Bibles-Hosanna-Revival-029_2.jpg","focal_point":"center center","section_height":"650px","title":"Hosanna Revival","title_size":72,"subheading":"Your Home for Beautiful Bibles","link":"","link_text":"","color_accent":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_align":"vertical-center horizontal-center"}},"70fffbe1-2a63-46c9-bf01-1a5c02302e86":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"css-id":"","css-class":"","color_bg":"#ffffff","color_text":"#000000","title":"Your Home for Beautiful Bibles","text":"<p>We exist to excite you about engaging in Scripture by creating beautiful and intentional tools for your life.

That fall when my illness worsened to a breaking point, I remembered the words of Ecclesiastes and took courage, for health is vapor—only the Lord is steady. Then in the spring, when I had to let go of so many things I loved in order to rest, I remembered the Preacher’s words that pleasures and accomplishments are “a striving after wind” (Ecclesiastes 2:11 ESV). God prepared my heart for these big changes by bringing me through a book that one might find confusing or depressing but actually holds great hope. <\/p><p>Ecclesiastes has been a love letter and lifeline from the Lord. It reminds me that God mourns with me. That his plan for my life can’t be “messed up” by the brokenness of the world. That success and productivity as the world sees them can’t touch a life well lived in the kingdom of God. And that when it all boils down, <em>enjoying God is the most meaningful thing I will ever do<\/em>, because God is the best thing. He is my home, my hope, and my healing.

We’d just moved to a new city in the thick of the pandemic. I spent those months unpacking boxes of familiar things into an unfamiliar house, carting two young sons to unfamiliar playgrounds with unfamiliar faces—half covered by masks—we weren’t allowed to get to know. We’d left a solid church, a rich community, and our families without the chance to say goodbye in order that we might bring the Gospel to a city a few hours north. I longed to go home that first year—begging God to make a way for us to go back to where we felt safe and comfortable.<\/p><p>Early one morning, as I read and cried in our living room, God pulled back the curtain on his purposes for me in this season of upheaval. “You’ve gotten to know the <em>things<\/em> of my Kingdom,” he whispered, “but I brought you here that you might finally get to know<em> me<\/em>.”<\/p><p>I’d had the rhythms, schedule, and intellectual understanding of any “good Christian”—I had the answers and the resume. But those are all circumstances, not a relationship. When our world turned on its side, I wanted a change of <em>circumstance<\/em>—the way I’d always experienced him<em>.<\/em> Instead, God gave me a change of awareness: a new sense of intimate knowledge of the God who’d brought us here in the first place.<\/p><p>Life in our new home has grown and flourished under God’s care. We’ve learned to love this place and these people. But our place and people are no match for the certainty of peace and belonging that come from being with the God who created, sees, and provides for us. He has become my home, and it’s made all the difference. I pray that in studying the gospel of John through <em>God Our Home<\/em>, you might also find the home you’re longing for.<br\/><\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","layout":"left"}},"362b51ae-2645-4f20-913e-add26fcf5641":{"type":"single-button","settings":{"alignment":"center","space_above":30,"space_below":30,"button_text":"BUY NOW","button_link":"https:\/\/hosannarevival.com\/products\/god-our-home","button_size":"huge"}},"6ddce9a6-40fa-491a-80fc-58d8f39314b3":{"type":"parallax-hero","settings":{"parallax":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/God-Our-Home-Beautiful-Scripture-Devotional-Katie-Noble-Hosanna-Revival-368.jpg","focal_point":"center center","section_height":"450px","title":"","title_size":72,"subheading":"","link":"https:\/\/hosannarevival.com\/products\/god-our-home","link_text":"SHOP GOD OUR HOME","color_accent":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_align":"vertical-center horizontal-center"}},"a65decb7-9c3f-4566-aa5c-258d35c3d603":{"type":"single-button","settings":{"alignment":"center","space_above":30,"space_below":30,"button_text":"Back to Devotional Library","button_link":"shopify:\/\/pages\/devotionals","button_size":"huge"}},"27013115-97e0-453d-96d5-6b0a0e9ac1a8":{"type":"featured-collection","settings":{"title":"Shop all devotionals","collection":"devotionals","per_row":5,"rows":1,"mobile_scrollable":true,"view_all":true}}},"block_order":["af9a2b0c-a56d-4326-879a-609ca4abc00b","73b552e5-0457-4738-a0f3-77591f24061c","ca79bc57-9803-4ad5-863a-e0f116948d9c","3508317d-ff15-485e-9424-33c28910dd71","b8d27944-72c3-4368-9309-6ee14c5af39e","40697f6d-6d44-43c6-8501-99d62f5fdf7a","938a791d-0073-494e-b2b7-4643647e4549","da746f0b-4260-46bb-84ef-1971c4d26396","98fc1525-b2f7-4d80-98e1-0c04723131b9","fd8a4a54-1a72-4127-9d56-c56d54a85284","2164c454-5887-4df3-802e-a694686d4afe","97a3c888-87e7-4e19-8b87-8bb3485410c8","ec723e1a-242d-4e25-893f-aa7c6662c78f","a806839d-fc31-4142-9003-db7ec60bf353","85eae3f3-17a5-4f53-88da-5cdeb31d135b","300b442e-c30a-43b8-aef7-784a2c15a66b","fa90acba-9c86-4dbf-915e-68c375d60143","362b51ae-2645-4f20-913e-add26fcf5641","6ddce9a6-40fa-491a-80fc-58d8f39314b3","a65decb7-9c3f-4566-aa5c-258d35c3d603","27013115-97e0-453d-96d5-6b0a0e9ac1a8"],"settings":{"page_title_enable":false,"page_content_enable":false}},"page-your-winter-collection-2023-template":{"type":"page-your-winter-collection-2023-template","blocks":{"111dc068-ad4f-4b43-93a8-f475a65a9ad1":{"type":"parallax-hero","settings":{"parallax":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Winter-Collection-Best-Aesthetic-Gifts-Beautiful-Bible-Hosanna-Revival-0001.jpg","focal_point":"center center","section_height":"750px","title":"RESTORE MY SOUL","title_size":72,"subheading":"A collection for the weary and worn","link":"https:\/\/hosannarevival.com\/collections\/winter-2023-collection","link_text":"shop winter collection 2023","color_accent":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_align":"vertical-center horizontal-center"}},"8b557416-8537-474e-be7e-b8826e57d948":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"css-id":"","css-class":"","color_bg":"#ffffff","color_text":"#000000","title":"RESTORE MY SOUL","text":"<p>“Restore my soul” is the heart’s cry behind this collection as God’s Word breaks fresh ground in our hearts through beauty.

As an English teacher, I could jump into the Bible and find the connections, understand the context, look through the original language, and overall feel like an incredible Bible scholar. But slowing down enough to let God’s Word transform my heart proved to be a bit harder. The “big” things were easy: don’t steal, don’t murder, don’t lie. It was the smaller moments of learning to let God engage in my every moment that was difficult. Somewhere along the path of having three kids in three years and life feeling out of control, I realized having an intellectual relationship with God wasn’t enough. Learning how not to simply read God’s Word for intellectual understanding, but discovering the joy that comes from allowing God to engage my knowledge in my small and large moments in life changed everything. <em>Beyond Egypt<\/em> is written from my experience.

Indeed, in many ways I did. I had a family that pointed me to the gospel of Jesus Christ and to the truth and power of the Scriptures as a source for life, hope, and flourishing. And yet, with all my worldly needs taken care of, I quickly found myself in a cage of emotional narcissism. All I could think about day to day was how I was feeling. And the majority of the time, I wasn’t feeling too good. I found myself heavily burdened by sorrow. The world seemed to be a very dark place to my weary eyes. I knew so many rich and healing biblical truths, but I rarely felt them. <\/p><p>My battle with depression that began during puberty continues to follow me today. Years of prayers, thoughtful conversations, counseling, and even medicinal treatment have all contributed to my current emotional progress. But it has been my exposure to the richness of God’s Word when it comes to my emotional life that has made all of those other elements effective. More and more, through careful study, patient prayer, and spiritual discipline, I am finding a way to feel the truth rather than simply understand the truth. I hope this book will help others start that very long and often discouraging journey of spiritual-emotional development.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"https:\/\/hosannarevival.com\/products\/in-weeping-and-rejoicing-by-paige-stitt-mcbride","layout":"right"}},"single_button_3gmwY3":{"type":"single-button","settings":{"alignment":"center","space_above":30,"space_below":30,"button_text":"buy

While not the only way to establish his kingdom on earth, we are created to model his love, kindness, and generosity first toward those in our homes. It is our daily opportunity to practice kingdom principles and be the hands and feet of Jesus to those around us.

Three little boys demanding, reaching, standing, and wanting to eat and run were not a recipe for peaceful, meaningful moments. However, deep in my heart, I had a vision of how mealtimes could become an anchor for the soul. <br\/><\/p><p>You see, as a young girl, I gathered around my grandmother's Sabbath table each Friday evening. I stood in holy reverence as she covered her eyes and lit our Sabbath candles. I will never forget the smells, the gentle candlelight, and the great love I knew at her table. As I watched the chaos ensue at my own dining room table, I knew there had to be a way to invite my sons into the ancient path of my Jewish upbringing—the path that developed a strong faith in my young heart. <br\/><\/p><p>So I pivoted. Instead of expecting fast and furious meal times, I played gentle worship music in the background and talked to my boys about our faith during meals. Sometimes we lit candles, other times we had teapots and special treats available to help them linger. Whatever I served (sometimes it was chicken nuggets and french fries from Chik-fil-A), I came to the table with purpose and intention: to share my faith and God's love with them. With a Bible in hand and a Spotify worship playlist cued up, I invited my sons to discourse about God and learn to worship him in our home during each meal. My pivot changed the atmosphere at our family table, and yours can too! <br\/><\/p><p><em>The Everyday Banquet<\/em> is designed to guide you and your family as you journey through the seasons and holidays of one calendar year together.

Every season also includes four original recipes and four hymns to use during family worship time.  Each week includes the same components: Preparation, In the Kitchen, Dining, Devotion & Reflection for one meaningful time at your dinner table.
