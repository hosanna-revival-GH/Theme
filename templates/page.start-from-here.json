Through these stories, we discover what holds us back from living a life filled to the very brim with the goodness of God.</p><p>It doesn’t matter whether you have known Jesus for a minute or thirty years, there is more to find. Let’s uncover the God who Jesus knows so well and examine the thought patterns that live within us that stand in the way of knowing him the way Jesus does. Relying on the words and actions of Jesus, we will encounter God because the character of Jesus awakens us to who God is and who God says we are. Wherever you are, and wherever you feel like God is, let’s start from here. Let’s start with the beauty of Jesus’ character and find God again.</p>",

Jesus was the one who pulled me close and he seemed so approachable, but that giant book felt like a labyrinth, impossible to understand. The nuances of Christianity were confusing and as a teen who had never set foot in a church, I had no idea where to begin. Maybe you’ve walked near to God for a while now, but you long for a fresh perspective; or, perhaps you crave a reintroduction to the one who drew you near in the first place. I’ve been in those places and every spot in between asking myself, “Where do I go from here?”</p><p>Jesus is the best place to start. Always. We might never understand the hows or whys about God, but we can always learn <em>who</em> he is. God is not far or unknowable, he is someone to meet, and he longs for us to draw closer to him. We have to let go of who God <em>isn’t</em> in order to meet him as he truly <em>is</em>. So wherever you might be today, let’s start from here, together, and discover the character of God. He is the starting and finish line, and, friend, he wants to run the race with us. </p>",
