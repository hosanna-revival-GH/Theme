            "question": "How is the Bible different from the Qur’an or other holy books?",
            "answer": "<p>The Bible was written over a period of about 1,500 years by more than forty different men of diverse backgrounds. Among this diverse group of writers are kings (David and Solomon), a military general (Joshua), a fisherman (Peter), and even a tent maker (Paul). Some of the books of the Bible were written from prison cells, the wilderness, exile, palaces, and more. There are books of historical narrative, poetry, letters, and eyewitness accounts of Jesus’s time on earth. All of this alone makes the Bible a unique book.</p><p>What truly sets the Bible apart from all other books—including other holy books—is that it has one ultimate author: God. Peter wrote in 2 Peter 1:21, “For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit” (ESV). Every book of the Bible—though written by many different people in many different places over a long period of time—tells one perfectly unified story because its author is God himself. Every word of the Bible is “breathed out” by God (2 Timothy 3:16) and is therefore holy, without error, and perfectly true. Even when we encounter challenging content within these pages, we can enter with this foundation of truth and take our understanding and wrestling before him with the humility to seek his heart within these pages.</p>",

            "question": "Why Do you say that the Bible has sixty-six books and not seventy-three like the Catholic Bible?",
            "answer": "<p>The doctrine that defines which books are considered part of the Bible is called canonicity. We could spend hours diving into this doctrine, but in this toolkit, we’ll offer a simple answer that we hope will get to the heart of the question. For context, the additional books included in Catholic Bibles were recorded after Old Testament books but before Jesus walked this earth. These books make up what is traditionally called the <em>Apocrypha</em>. In his earthly ministry, Jesus affirmed the Old Testament and authorized his apostles to write the New Testament, but he never affirmed or even cited the apocryphal writings. We believe in the absolute authority of Jesus, and we therefore affirm what he affirmed. </p><p>A study of the four gospel accounts in Scripture reveals Jesus affirmed the whole of the Old Testament, accounting for the total of sixty-six books when paired with the New Testament writings (Matthew 5:17–18). He affirmed it as a reliable record of history (cf. Matthew 10:15; 12:40; 19:3–5; 24:38–39) and prophetic accuracy (Matthew 26:54). He affirmed it as sufficient (Luke 16:31), unified (Luke 24:27, 44), without error (Matthew 22:29; John 17:17), infallible (John 10:35), and authoritative (Matthew 21:13, 16, 42). History also shows that first-century Jews did not consider the apocryphal writings to be canonical Scripture, and neither did Jesus. So while these writings are rich with historical context, they do not serve as an essential foundation for knowing God.</p>",

            "question": "Isn’t the Bible boring?",
            "answer": "<p>The Bible—God’s written words to us—is the primary way in which he has chosen to reveal himself to us. It is literally God’s letter to us. Imagine the feeling of receiving a letter in the mail from someone you love dearly. Are you excited to open and read it? Or does it evoke feelings of boredom? </p><p>In truth, our view of Scripture is directly related to our view of God. The Bible is not boring because God is not boring. A life of obedience to Christ is a life of adventure. The Bible is filled with stories where God calls his followers into this adventure. When our minds and hearts are aligned with the reality that God is our loving Father who desires to commune with us through his Word and invite us into this adventure, it comes alive! </p><p>If you are struggling to find Scripture interesting, read a modern translation that you find easy to understand. We recommend the NLT if you are just beginning or the ESV if you wish to dive into deep study right away. As you read, try journaling your thoughts and answering these questions: </p><p><strong>1.

            "question": "What if I think some of the Bible is true, but not all of it?",
            "answer": "<p>For many years, modern scholars have challenged the authenticity and truthfulness of Scripture by comparing it to ancient legends and searching out errors within the text. However, a variety of evidence reveals quite the opposite. In fact, the Bible could be considered one of most astounding primary texts in history given the breadth of consistency and cross-reference both within and without the text. Between all the manuscripts available to us, the margin of error is less than 1%, and, even then, the discrepancies do not raise confusion to the meaning of the text or change the doctrine of Scripture. Thus, despite the challenges scholars have raised to the Bible, it continues to prove itself a legitimage historical text relating true events. When pairing this evidence with the claim the Bible presents of this being the very Word of God and thus revealing God’s heart for our lives, the question becomes not just, “Is it true?” but, “Will it be true for <em>me</em>?” </p><p>If you are asking this question, take a moment to explore whether there is a more specific <em>why</em> behind your ask. Have you been surrounded by people who discredit the Bible—or seem to support it blindly? Are there parts of it you are uncomfortable with or simply don’t like? The beauty of God’s character is that he does not shy away from your hard questions. We encourage you to take the time to explore your questions while at the same time challenge you to consider what it would look like to enter into reading his Word from the posture of trusting it as truth. Take heart, God delights in revealing to you the treasure you hold!</p>",

            "question": "What if I find the Bible to be too complex or hard to understand?",
            "answer": "<p>The Bible is a complex book containing deep, rich truths. It is normal to find it confusing and difficult to understand at times. But it is not unknowable. In fact, one way the Holy Spirit of God ministers to us is opening our eyes to understand the beauty and truth in the Word of God. God does not withhold good from his children, and that includes the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 1:13). If you belong to Jesus, the Holy Spirit lives in you, and will “guide you into all truth” (John 16:13). There are hard things in Scripture, but we’re never meant to understand them all on our own. A couple tips:</p><ul><li>Find a friend to study the Bible with. </li><li>Start with a Study Bible! The notes and commentary on the text provide a lot of help for understanding difficult passages.</li><li>Pray! Psalm 119:18 is a wonderful prayer for each time you open the Bible: “Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.”</li><li>Find a translation that fits your current goals. For a highly literal translation, we recommend <a href=\"https://hosannarevival.com/collections/beautiful-bibles/esv\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hosannarevival.com/collections/beautiful-bibles/esv\">the ESV</a>. For something easier to read without sacrificing accuracy, we recommend <a href=\"/collections/nlt-bibles\" title=\"NLT Bibles\">the NLT</a> or <a href=\"https://hosannarevival.com/collections/beautiful-bibles/csb\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hosannarevival.com/collections/beautiful-bibles/csb\">CSB</a>.</li></ul><p>The Holy Spirit of God authored the Bible.

            "question": "What if I don’t have time to read the Bible?",
            "answer": "<p>Sometimes, the Bible seems like an unclimbable mountain of sixty-six books divided into 1,189 chapters. We can discourage ourselves by thinking we have to read a certain amount every time we open it or that we have to read through the Bible at least once every year. Those aren’t bad things; in fact, spiritual discipline is very important in the life of the Christian. Although just fifteen minutes of daily reading will get you through the whole Bible in a year, many us still find ourselves saying we “don’t have enough time.” What if we don’t actually need more time; we simply need to better prioritize the time we have?</p><p>If we truly believe God is who he says he is and that the Bible truly is God’s Word, we will rearrange our priorities around God, rather than giving him what’s left. In this guide, you will find many practical tips that will spur you on to make space for God’s Word.</p><p><em>Check out our WHEN article \"</em><a href=\"https://hosannarevival.blog/when-reading-the-bible-isnt-a-priority/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"When Reading the Bible is Hard to Prioritize, an article by Hosanna Revival\"><em>When Reading the Bible is Hard to Prioritize</em></a><em>\"</em></p>",

Together, these sections—containing a total of sixty-six individual books inspired by God and written by more than forty different individuals throughout history—tell one complete story of who God is and what he has done. The books are divided into chapters and verses to help you find specific parts of the story. Next, we’ve included a breakdown of each section of the Bible. <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0074/7674/0155/files/Bible-Toolkit-Hosanna-Revival.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0074/7674/0155/files/Bible-Toolkit-Hosanna-Revival.pdf\">Print out our guide here</a> to take alongside you as you learn.</p>",

But when Adam and Eve sinned, it all came crashing down. Adam and Eve were created holy and perfectly happy in God’s creation, but that perfect harmony with God was destroyed and the earth was cursed as a result of their sin. </p><p><strong>The Account of Israel: </strong>The story of Israel is a fairly similar narrative. God saves Abraham’s descendants from Egyptian slavery and exile and leads them into a lush, green land he promised to Abraham hundreds of years earlier. But just like Adam, the children of Israel rebelled against God and were exiled from the Promised Land. </p><p><strong>How it Ends:</strong> The Old Testament ends with the children of Israel—Abraham’s descendants—returning to the Promised Land, but it is no longer the paradise it once was. They are still in exile under foreign rule. There is conflict and pain. The weight of the curse still remained, but so did the promise of God to send a Savior—the Messiah—to break this curse and put an end to suffering once and for all. But the question remained: when and how would God fulfill this long-awaited promise?</p>",

Instead, he had come for a much greater purpose: to break the curse of sin. Jesus came to live a perfect life and die in the place of sinners, reconciling them back to God—bringing us back to the garden paradise where we can once again have perfect harmony and peace with God. </p><p><strong>How it Ends</strong>: The New Testament ends with the promise of a future in a new heaven and a new earth. No more sin, no more curse, no more sickness, no more death. God will make all things new and will once again dwell with his people.</p>",
