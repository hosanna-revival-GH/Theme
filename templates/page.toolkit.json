Among this diverse group of writers are kings (David and Solomon), a military general (Joshua), a fisherman (Peter), and even a tent maker (Paul). Some of the books of the Bible were written from prison cells, the wilderness, exile, palaces, and more. There are books of historical narrative, poetry, letters, and eyewitness accounts of Jesus’ time on earth. All of this alone makes the Bible a unique book. </p><p>But what truly sets the Bible apart from all other books—including other holy books—is that it has one ultimate author: God. Peter wrote in 2 Peter 1:21, “For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.” Every book of the Bible—though written by many different people in many different places over a long period of time—tells one perfectly unified story because its author is God himself. Every word of the Bible is “breathed out” by God (2 Timothy 3:16) and is therefore holy, without error, and perfectly true.</p>"

We could spend hours diving into this doctrine, but in this Bible Toolkit, we’ll offer a simple answer that we hope will get to the heart of the issue. In his earthly ministry, Jesus <em>affirmed</em> the Old Testament and <em>authorized</em> his apostles to write the New Testament. We believe in the absolute authority of Jesus, and we therefore affirm what he affirmed. </p><p>A study of the four gospel accounts in Scripture reveals Jesus affirmed the whole of the Old Testament (Matthew 5:17-18). He affirmed it as a reliable record of history (cf. Matthew 10:15; 19:3-5; 12:40; 24:38-39) and prophetic accuracy (Matthew 26:54). He affirmed it as sufficient (Luke 16:31), unified (Luke 24:27,44), without error (Matthew 22:29; John 17:17), infallible (John 10:35), and authoritative (Matthew 21:13, 16, 42). History also shows that first century Jews did not consider the Apocryphal writings to be canonical Scripture, and neither did Jesus. He never affirmed or even cited the Apocryphal writings. </p><p></p><p><em>For more information on this topic, see </em><a href=\"https://blog.tms.edu/why-these-66-books\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.tms.edu/why-these-66-books\"><em>this article</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
