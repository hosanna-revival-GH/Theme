But those things simply cannot satisfy our heart-felt desire for true, lasting meaning. We know we were meant for something more. This is because eternity was planted deep in our hearts by our Eternal Creator.</p><p>In the middle of our Bibles is an often overlooked and misunderstood book called Ecclesiastes that asks questions like “How can I live a meaningful life?” and “Why does life feel pointless sometimes?” The wisdom of Ecclesiastes teaches us that true meaning and permanence come from God and that living through the lens of eternity brings meaning and richness to all of life. This 7-week study leads the reader through the entire book of Ecclesiastes. <em>Eternity in Our Hearts</em> is for anyone who wants to understand challenging parts of Scripture, live life richly, and encounter the heart of our Heavenly Father.</p>",
