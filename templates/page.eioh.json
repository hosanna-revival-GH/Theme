But those things simply cannot satisfy our heart-felt desire for true, lasting meaning. We know we were meant for something more. This is because eternity was planted deep in our hearts by our Eternal Creator.</p><p>In the middle of our Bibles is an often overlooked and misunderstood book called Ecclesiastes that asks questions like “How can I live a meaningful life?” and “Why does life feel pointless sometimes?” The wisdom of Ecclesiastes teaches us that true meaning and permanence come from God and that living through the lens of eternity brings meaning and richness to all of life. This 7-week study leads the reader through the entire book of Ecclesiastes. <em>Eternity in Our Hearts</em> is for anyone who wants to understand challenging parts of Scripture, live life richly, and encounter the heart of our Heavenly Father.</p>",

              "text": "<p>I studied Ecclesiastes the summer before my health fell apart, and it was God’s protection and preparation. That fall when my illness worsened to a breaking point, I remembered the words of Ecclesiastes and took courage, for health is vapor—only the Lord is steady. Then in the spring, when I had to let go of so many things I loved in order to rest, I remembered the Preacher’s words that pleasures and accomplishments are “a striving after wind” (Ecclesiastes 2:11 ESV). God prepared my heart for these big changes by bringing me through a book that one might find confusing or depressing but actually holds great hope. </p><p>Ecclesiastes has been a love letter and lifeline from the Lord. It reminds me that God mourns with me. That his plan for my life can’t be “messed up” by the brokenness of the world. That success and productivity as the world sees them can’t touch a life well lived in the kingdom of God. And that when it all boils down, <em>enjoying God is the most meaningful thing I will ever do</em>, because God is the best thing. He is my home, my hope, and my healing. Rich life begins, ends, and finds its meaning in him. What better place to be?</p>",
