Have you ever felt confused about the world’s response to injustice, unsure of how to respond yourself?</p><p>If so, we encourage you to open up <em>Just: A Journey into the Mercy of God</em>. Through these pages, author Brooke Jackson leads with love as she gently invites you to examine your own belief about injustice by looking at how Jesus interacted with people while walking this earth. If you are challenged by these questions and desire to understand God’s heart for justice, this devotional is for you.</p><p>Over six sections, <em>Just</em> invites you to discover God’s just character through the accounts and actions of Jesus. God’s mercy and compassion towards those in the margins is evident throughout Scripture. Through bite-sized readings and thought-provoking questions, you will unpack stories of Jesus as he heals those who are physically and spiritually bereft while observing how he teaches about the true nature of justice in the kingdom of God. We pray that <em>Just</em> would meet you where you’re at and bring you deeper into the loving and merciful character of Christ as you discover more of his heart for justice. </p>",

        "text": "<p>Growing up, I associated God’s justice with God’s wrath. Full stop. Even though my family and I faithfully attended church, volunteered in ministries, and I attended Christian schools where I earned great grades, I was terrified of God. No matter how many times I heard that God is love, it was hard to distance that picture from a crime-and-punishment mindset. The more I turned to Scripture to answer the questions I had about the nature of God and his justice, the more I discovered how frequently God’s justice involved caring for the fatherless, the widow, and the orphan. I found that God’s Word was full of instruction for his people to do right, seek justice, and defend the oppressed. And because Jesus was the exact representation of God the Father, he faithfully embodied God’s character throughout his life and ministry. My hope is that by examining the stories and actions of Jesus you will see God’s heart for those on the margins, the thread of God’s just nature throughout time, and his hope to use people who reflect his justice toward others.  </p>",
