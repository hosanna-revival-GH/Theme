Have you ever felt confused about the world’s response to injustice, unsure of how to respond yourself?</p><p>If so, we encourage you to open up <em>Just: A Journey into the Mercy of God</em>. Through these pages, author Brooke Jackson leads with love as she gently invites you to examine your own belief about injustice by looking at how Jesus interacted with people while walking this earth. If you are challenged by these questions and desire to understand God’s heart for justice, this devotional is for you.</p><p>Over six sections, <em>Just</em> invites you to discover God’s just character through the accounts and actions of Jesus. God’s mercy and compassion towards those in the margins is evident throughout Scripture. Through bite-sized readings and thought-provoking questions, you will unpack stories of Jesus as he heals those who are physically and spiritually bereft while observing how he teaches about the true nature of justice in the kingdom of God. We pray that <em>Just</em> would meet you where you’re at and bring you deeper into the loving and merciful character of Christ as you discover more of his heart for justice. </p>",

If you have ever struggled to understand how the gospel relates to your mental health and emotions, this book is for you. </p>",

        "text": "<p>Growing up in a loving, stable Christian home, it would seem that I had all I needed to flourish. Indeed, in many ways I did. I had a family that pointed me to the gospel of Jesus Christ and to the truth and power of the Scriptures as a source for life, hope, and flourishing. And yet, with all my worldly needs taken care of, I quickly found myself in a cage of emotional narcissism. All I could think about day to day was how I was feeling. And the majority of the time, I wasn’t feeling too good. I found myself heavily burdened by sorrow. The world seemed to be a very dark place to my weary eyes. I knew so many rich and healing biblical truths, but I rarely felt them. </p><p>My battle with depression that began during puberty continues to follow me today. Years of prayers, thoughtful conversations, counseling, and even medicinal treatment have all contributed to my current emotional progress. But it has been my exposure to the richness of God’s Word when it comes to my emotional life that has made all of those other elements effective. More and more, through careful study, patient prayer, and spiritual discipline, I am finding a way to feel the truth rather than simply understand the truth. I hope this book will help others start that very long and often discouraging journey of spiritual-emotional development.</p>",
