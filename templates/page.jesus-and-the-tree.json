After all, it is Christ who “bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed” (1 Peter 2:24).”</p>",

Jesus’s death and resurrection are the moment of redemption. And while that is something we mostly rejoice in, the week leading up to the resurrection was not wholly celebratory. Instead, it was full of sorrow, pain, and rejection. It was a week in which Jesus was abandoned by his friends, ridiculed and mocked by the religious and those in power, and ultimately condemned to die. In that week, Jesus was broken. Yet it is only in his brokenness that our salvation is realized.”</p><p><em>— Brooke Jackson</em></p>",

She came to her work as she was being drawn into God’s heart for those who are vulnerable and in need. Brooke has been a follower of Jesus since she was a teenager. While earning her degree in English (with a focus on creative writing), she was active in various campus ministries, worked with other college students, and led and taught Bible studies, devotionals, and women’s retreats. Brooke’s career has given her opportunities to utilize a Christ-centered lens to train faith communities on the intersection of faith and justice.</p>",
