You will also, like some mystical tale of old, find yourself woven into this epic that unfolds. You will see that this story is <em>your</em> story. It is <em>our</em> story. And you and I have a part to play in it. </p><p>As you walk through each of the six parts of <em>The Story Circle</em>—from Beauty to Beauty—you will be given a chance to <strong>write</strong> out the story in your own words, <strong>remember</strong> key portions of Scripture, and <strong>reflect</strong> with questions designed to let you see that this Story is also your story. So, come—come discover who you are and who you were meant to be as you find that story that is yours as well.</p>",

I “knew” all the right answers to the questions in Sunday School and could pronounce all those crazy names like Melchizedek. The problem was I didn’t care about any of it, and I certainly didn’t know how any of it fit together. I knew the Bible like someone knows the index of a book. I could tell you all of the facts, but I couldn’t tell you how the story all fit together. I was like the Star Wars nerd who knew the name of every planet in the galaxy, the speed and weapons of every ship, and what the buttons did on Darth Vader’s suit. But I had never actually watched the movie, and had no clue what the story line actually was. Learning to read the Bible as one whole story transformed my entire life and gave me an understanding of the good news that Jesus has come to bring to a very broken world.</p>",
