This Christmas, step into intentionally spending time with the Savior first thing in the morning. Reflect on the miracle of God sending his Son to earth and the thrill of hope that our hearts experience because of it. This is the time to rejoice over the birth of our King! Start your Christmas morning<strong>s</strong> with your Savior, and let every joyful moment that follows be a reminder of God's love for you and how he sent his one and only Son for you. </p>",
