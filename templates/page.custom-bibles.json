As we have grown, our artist and founder, Katie, spends her time designing new products, leading our team, and growing the company. She no longer has the capacity to accept custom hand-painted orders at regular intervals. However, because custom work is near and dear to her heart, we have created a custom design submission process! Anyone interested in a custom hand-painted Bible can submit their design idea using the form below. We will review the submissions periodically and select custom projects that are a good fit for our brand and design capacity. We love to review your ideas and see your creativity!</p><p><em>*If you are in a rush, we wouldn't recommend this process and encourage you to find another artist on Etsy or consider our beautiful printed Bibles in our shop.</em></p>"
