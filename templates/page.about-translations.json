Rather than taking each word and finding the most accurate English equivalent, they attempted to translate the Bible on a ‘meaning-for-meaning” basis. The result is a Bible translation with excellent readability that remains faithful to the text of Scripture.</p>",

In meaning-based translations, the translators start with a source-language text and dig beneath the surface to discover its meaning.

In fact, we think a better question is, “Which Bible translation is best for me?” Before we can answer that question, we need to understand a little bit more about how the Bible is translated. There are two main translation philosophies when it comes to translating the Bible:</p><p><strong>1. Word-for-Word translation</strong> (also known as “essentially literal” or “formal equivalence”)<br/><strong>2. Thought-for-Thought translation</strong> (also known as “functional equivalence,” or “dynamic equivalence,” or “meaning-based”)</p><p>In recent years, some Bible translations have attempted to fall somewhere between these two philosophies, forming a “natural equivalence” or “optimal equivalence” translation philosophy. In addition to these three translation philosophies, some have chosen a different method altogether, resulting in a paraphrased retelling of Scripture.</p>",
