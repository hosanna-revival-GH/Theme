We observe and learn from Jesus that he had 12 disciples who followed him closely and learned from his actions and teachings. These men watched how Jesus spoke,prayed, and responded to conflict. They invited Jesus into their lives, homes, and families. In the same way, one of the most beautiful relationships you can step into is a discipleship relationship with someone you care about. Discipleship is an opportunity to walk alongside someone and invite them into every area of your life as you actively pursue the Lord.  When we build into someone in a close discipleship relationship, we are modeling in word and action how to love and follow Jesus.</p>",
