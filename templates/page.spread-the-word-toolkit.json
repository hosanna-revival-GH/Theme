They invited Jesus into their lives, homes, and families. In the same way, one of the most beautiful relationships you can step into is a discipleship relationship with someone you care about.

        "text": "<p>Jesus says in Matthew 28:19, “Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.” What does it mean to “make disciples”? We observe and learn from Jesus that he had 12 disciples who followed him closely and learned from his actions and teachings. These men watched how Jesus spoke,prayed, and responded to conflict. They invited Jesus into their lives, homes, and families. In the same way, one of the most beautiful relationships you can step into is a discipleship relationship with someone you care about. Discipleship is an opportunity to walk alongside someone and invite them into every area of your life as you actively pursue the Lord.  When we build into someone in a close discipleship relationship, we are modeling in word and action how to love and follow Jesus.</p>",

The purpose for your life is to be loved by God, and to tell others about the unending, abounding, and fulfilling love of God. When we walk in that purpose, we carry the gospel to others like it was first carried to us, and we experience the joy of living out God’s mission for our lives </li></ul>",
