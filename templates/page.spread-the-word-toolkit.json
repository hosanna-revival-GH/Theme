When you share how God has moved in your life, you get to explain the very real impact that a relationship with Jesus can have. You can do this in a casual way, by sharing simply how a relationship with God has healed certain parts of your heart or given you hope—or whatever feels right for you! If the person you are sharing with is curious to hear more, you can explain in greater detail how your story with God played out! </li><li>Tip: don’t make this out to be too complicated. Think about how someone might share how a mentor or teacher impacted them. You can casually share what God has done without creating an awkward lead up. Speak with confidence about how you’ve seen God move in your life; those who hear this story will be blessed </li></ul>",

Our time—once spent seeking personal satisfaction and affirmation from others—shifts toward honoring him. This change can sometimes be confusing to those who don’t share the same faith. How you spend your time can serve as a natural way to share your faith. Others may become curious and ask <em>why</em> you do—or don’t do—certain things, opening the door for meaningful conversations about your beliefs and the transformation Jesus brings.  </li><li>Examples: What are you doing this weekend? <em>I’ll go to church sunday. </em>Did you have a good start to your day? <em>Yes, I always start my day in prayer or reading the Bible if I’m not too rushed. It helps me start the day with a clear mind. </em>Where did you get that shirt? <em>A girl in my small group gave it to me.</em></li><li>Tip<em>: </em>Like in the examples above, never miss an opportunity to mention your faith. When people hear you talking about the natural ways your faith is a part of your life, it becomes a conversation starter for them, and makes approaching you about faith even easier.</li></ul>",

In the same way, we should strive to be good listeners to the people around us, seeking to understand what they’re saying while also keeping our ears open to the Holy Spirit as he prompts us to respond.
