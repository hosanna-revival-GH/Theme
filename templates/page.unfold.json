In this 6-week study, you will embark on an introspective journey through the Scriptures to confront the sin in your life with joyful repentance for the purpose of keeping your heart pure, loving, and soft toward the Lord. <em>Unfold </em>is firmly rooted in the gospel of grace with a focus on inviting God’s sharp and discerning Word to search the thoughts and intentions of your heart (Hebrews 4:12) and directing all conviction to the cross of Christ. Inspired by the beautiful imagery in “The Hymn of Joy”, this tool is for anyone who desires to have their heart unfold like a flower before God, opening to the true Light of this world. </p><p>Each week walks you through a different aspect of sanctification, whether that be repentance and regeneration, faith versus works, hidden sin and holiness, jealousy, pride, finances, gluttony, heartbreak and suffering, or the hope of eternity. Each day’s entry is designed to pull you into a rhythm of reading, reflecting, repenting, and rejoicing, which will allow you to unpack Scripture, ponder guided questions, write down your prayers, and engage in a time of thanksgiving and worship. Our prayer for you is that this book will restore your joy in your salvation (Psalm 51:12) and give you a renewed desire to store up the Word of God in your heart.</p>",
