In this 6-week study, you will embark on an introspective journey through the Scriptures to confront the sin in your life with joyful repentance for the purpose of keeping your heart pure, loving, and soft toward the Lord. <em>Unfold </em>is firmly rooted in the gospel of grace with a focus on inviting God’s sharp and discerning Word to search the thoughts and intentions of your heart (Hebrews 4:12) and directing all conviction to the cross of Christ. Inspired by the beautiful imagery in “The Hymn of Joy”, this tool is for anyone who desires to have their heart unfold like a flower before God, opening to the true Light of this world. </p><p>Each week walks you through a different aspect of sanctification, whether that be repentance and regeneration, faith versus works, hidden sin and holiness, jealousy, pride, finances, gluttony, heartbreak and suffering, or the hope of eternity. Each day’s entry is designed to pull you into a rhythm of reading, reflecting, repenting, and rejoicing, which will allow you to unpack Scripture, ponder guided questions, write down your prayers, and engage in a time of thanksgiving and worship. Our prayer for you is that this book will restore your joy in your salvation (Psalm 51:12) and give you a renewed desire to store up the Word of God in your heart.</p>",

              "text": "<p>Growing up in the church, I wholeheartedly believed that Jesus died on the cross for my sins and that salvation is a gift that cannot be earned. But when I continued reading the rest of the New Testament’s teachings on the renewed, holy life of a Christian, I felt crushed by how impossible it all seemed. Instead of basking in God’s endless grace and new mercies each morning, I allowed my heart to wallow in sin and condemnation, eventually straying from his ways. You see, the problem was that I thought I had to <em>keep </em>my salvation by my own efforts. My relationship with God was dependent on my performance. Thankfully, Jesus shone his light on my heart during my university years, reigniting my faith and fervor with a renewed realization of the meaning of grace. </p><p>I wrote <em>Unfold </em>with the prayer that it would be a tool to help others channel the heavy feelings of conviction into a hopeful repentance as we rejoice at the foot of the cross. This devotional will show you that you don’t have to strive to live a life that is pleasing to God to keep your place as his child. It is exactly because you are in Christ that you can seek God daily, confess your sins, and trust that he will continue to wash and renew your heart even if you keep messing up. God doesn’t need you to be perfect. He just wants you and your heart.</p>",
