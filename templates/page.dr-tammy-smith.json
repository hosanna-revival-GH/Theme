Combined with the difficulties of life - the curveballs, twists, turns and crushing valleys, it is a miracle - truly a miracle - that we have stayed the course.Through the times where I felt hopelessly trapped in a mismatched marriage, the years-in-a-row where we assumed anything but the best about each other, the intimacy struggles and sleep-on-the-couch nights, Jesus has shown us that staying the course, even if holding on by a very thin thread to marital vows, continuing to try and believe in faith year after year…it’s all worth it.</p><p>And it’s a miracle.” </p><p>- Dr. Tammy Smith</p>",

A child abandoned by her mother, searching for love in all the wrong places, and performing for whatever crumb of approval she might get, I was on a path that would have led to certain self-sabotage and destruction. When the Lord graciously grabbed hold of my heart, he gave me my true identity and purpose. I can honestly say that Not a day goes by that I don’t feel the pull to forfeit that security and seek my identity in the world and in what others say about me. Some days are better than others, but knowing I have a fortress of love and grace—my soul’s true home—gives me a peace and joy that the fleeting promises and pleasures of this world could never offer.”</p><p>- Dr. Tammy Smith</p>",
