Parents and children alike are bombarded with cultural norms, work expectations, and the demands of peers and teachers. As we return home, it is easy to continue on separately, to decompress in front of a device, or read a book alone. However, the family was designed by God to establish his kingdom on earth. While not the only way to establish his kingdom on earth, we are created to model his love, kindness, and generosity first toward those in our homes. It is our daily opportunity to practice kingdom principles and be the hands and feet of Jesus to those around us. When we sit at our dining room tables and engage with one another intentionally, we have a kingdom opportunity to impart his truth in a unique way. </p><p>So, may it start today. Grab your oven mitt and your favorite Bible, tell your children to meet you in the kitchen, and come to the table for an everyday banquet.”</p><p>- SarahRuth Owens, <em>The Everyday Banquet</em> </p>",

      "text": "<p>In the hustle and bustle of early motherhood, I found mealtimes to be chaotic and stressful. Three little boys demanding, reaching, standing, and wanting to eat and run were not a recipe for peaceful, meaningful moments. However, deep in my heart, I had a vision of how mealtimes could become an anchor for the soul. <br/></p><p>You see, as a young girl, I gathered around my grandmother's Sabbath table each Friday evening. I stood in holy reverence as she covered her eyes and lit our Sabbath candles. I will never forget the smells, the gentle candlelight, and the great love I knew at her table. As I watched the chaos ensue at my own dining room table, I knew there had to be a way to invite my sons into the ancient path of my Jewish upbringing—the path that developed a strong faith in my young heart. <br/></p><p>So I pivoted. Instead of expecting fast and furious meal times, I played gentle worship music in the background and talked to my boys about our faith during meals. Sometimes we lit candles, other times we had teapots and special treats available to help them linger. Whatever I served (sometimes it was chicken nuggets and french fries from Chik-fil-A), I came to the table with purpose and intention: to share my faith and God's love with them. With a Bible in hand and a Spotify worship playlist cued up, I invited my sons to discourse about God and learn to worship him in our home during each meal. My pivot changed the atmosphere at our family table, and yours can too! <br/></p><p><em>The Everyday Banquet</em> is designed to guide you and your family as you journey through the seasons and holidays of one calendar year together. It is organized in such a way that you can learn from my own mistakes and get the package deal—a thoughtfully-organized, faith-filled devotional for your family to enjoy as you come to the table. </p>"

Each week includes the same components: Preparation, In the Kitchen, Dining, Devotion & Reflection for one meaningful time at your dinner table.
