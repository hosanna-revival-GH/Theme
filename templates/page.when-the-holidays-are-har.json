More crazy than cozy. And you’re not alone. </p><p>Thanksgiving and Christmas are usually portrayed with perfectly set table tops, mouth-watering side dishes, pretty little packages, and smiles all around. You don’t often see the social media influencer posting about the argument at their family gathering. Catalogs don’t show us the girls who actually read them, wishing they could look like the models on the pages. Ads for our favorite brands aren’t trying to appeal to the woman mourning the loss of a loved one. Yet these realities are all too familiar for many of us during the holiday season.</p><p><em>When the Holidays Are Hard</em> will acknowledge some of the challenges we face in our relationships with others during this time of year. Over these next nine days, you will receive a short, topical study containing practical, biblical wisdom from writers we love. Whether you feel weighed down by the stressful expectations of hosting and gifting, apprehensive about seeing certain family members, worried about what the gossip will be at the table this year, or just simply alone, I hope something in this series will hold your hand as you walk into the weary days ahead. </p>",
