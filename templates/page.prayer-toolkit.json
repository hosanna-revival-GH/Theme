In other words, without Jesus, we have no hope of any access to a perfect and holy God. But to those who love Jesus and follow him, we are covered in his righteousness—we bear his name. When we pray in the name of Jesus, we have every access to God. Every wall has been torn down and every barrier has been removed—we get to enter boldly into the holy place of the presence of God (Hebrews 10:19, 4:16)—like a child, completely unafraid to approach their dad.</p>",

However, we have to be careful not to forget about the rest of the Bible. This verse does not mean to promise that Jesus will <em>always</em> give you <em>everything</em> you want just because you asked for it. The Scriptures say much more about prayer that we must also consider when we’re making our requests known to God. You cannot pray “in Jesus’ name” <em>against</em> the will of God. Jesus is God. He is not divided against himself. This is why John (who wrote John 14:14) <em>also</em> wrote 1 John 5:15, which says, “And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything <strong>according to his will</strong> he hears us.” Praying in Jesus’ name means we pray for things that will honor and glorify Jesus—true prayer is in agreement with God’s will.</p>"

Have you ever prayed something like, “God, if you do this for me, I will ________________”? There are times when genuine prayers—prayed in Jesus’ name and for the glory of God—are prayed like this.</p><p>In 1 Samuel, we meet a woman named Hannah, who had no children. She prayed fervently for years that God would give her a son. She promised God that if he gave her a son, she would “give him to the LORD all the days of his life” (1 Samuel 1:11). God heard Hannah’s prayers and granted her a son. The first chapter of 1 Samuel ends with the famous verse, “For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him” (1 Samuel 1:27). </p><p>Sometimes, however, we use prayers like this in selfish ways that do not honor or glorify Christ. To use a silly example: if you procrastinated all week for a test, then pray, “God if you help me pass this test, I will study next time” when you <em>know</em> you’re not going to try any harder next time, you’re probably going to fail your test—and it won’t be on God.

A closer look at Scripture, however, reveals that as we grow in the Lord, we understand that prayer is not so much about getting something <em>from</em> God, but rather getting more <em>of</em> God. Prayer is communion with God! It is an intimate time of communing with our Father in heaven. When you think of a best friend or even a really good friend, you probably think of someone you speak to often. For some of us, it’s someone we speak to every single day, and that makes sense—you can’t be close to someone you never speak to. God is our Father, and he loves to hear from his children.</p><p>In Psalm 141:2 the psalmist writes, “Let my prayer be counted as incense before you.” In Revelation 5:8 and Revelation 8:5, we see that God truly does keep every prayer of his children in bowls—they are a sweet-smelling incense to him. Billions of prayers, prayed throughout every century since the dawn of time are kept and treasured by God our Father. </p><p>If you feel distant from God, or are uncomfortable speaking to him with such closeness, start small. Pray simple prayers (use the tips included at the end of this toolkit). Read his Word to learn more about his character and his loving heart for you. He wants to hear from you, and the more you speak to him, the more you will grow to love and trust him.</p>"

John Piper once said, “God is always doing 10,000 things in your life, and you may be aware of three of them.” </p><p>When you pray consistently, you will be more perceptive of God moving in your life. If you have prayed for opportunities to share Jesus with a friend who doesn’t know him, you will be more likely to notice when God answers those prayers than if you hadn’t prayed. God may have given you those opportunities before, but because you’re praying about it, you’ll be more aware of God’s answers to those prayers. If you never took your requests to God in prayer, you might miss God’s movement in your life—even though he is certainly moving! It’s too easy for us to forget God’s loving heart for us and that he is working all things together for his glory and our good. </p><p>Trusting God with your prayers also deepens your trust, as you will see God prove himself faithful time and time again. God has always been faithful, but when we’re not spending time in prayer, we may miss his kind acts of faithfulness in our lives. God is faithful to provide for our needs and to answer our prayers. As you see more and more of God’s faithfulness, your faith will grow, your trust will be strengthened, and your heart will become grateful, responding in praise to our good and faithful God.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Just before teaching his disciples how to pray in Matthew 6, Jesus said this: “And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.” Sometimes we may have the desire to pray, but we feel like our request is too small—like we shouldn’t bother God with such things. We feel like prayers should be more “meaningful;” prayed with eloquence and poise. Jesus lovingly reminds us it’s not all about the style or length of our prayers. One of the most sincere, heart-felt prayers in all of Scripture only contained three words: “Lord, save me!” (Matthew 14:30).</p><p>You have the freedom to pray simply. You don’t need an impressive vocabulary to pray fervent, effectual prayers. You also don’t need massive, life-changing events or heartbreaking trials. God cares about the smallest, minute moments of your life, and he wants to hear from you.</p><p>Start small—begin your day with a prayer, thanking God for a new day and asking him to bless you as you move about your day. Maybe it will be something small, like hitting all green lights so you’re not late to a meeting. But because you prayed over your day, you will be mindful to think of God when those things happen. You will be able to recognize small joys as gracious gifts from a loving Father, and you will be able to take a moment to offer up a prayer of thanksgiving—continuing to build a habit of constant prayer.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>The Bible also contains its very own book of prayer: the Psalms. The Psalms teach us to pray through imitating the psalmist (and his God-breathed prayers) and responding to God. True prayer is always a response to God’s revelation; as he reveals things to us (about his nature, about our sin, about the world), we respond in prayer.</p><p>The Psalms are also deeply personal and honest. As we read through the psalter, we will find prayers that may cause us to think, “Am I allowed to pray that?” We like things to be authentic, but we like them to be neat and pretty. Anything too “raw” or real tends to make us uncomfortable, but the various writers of the Psalms don’t make any attempt to hide their emotions. They vividly and honestly express the deepest feelings of their hearts, and we can, too.</p><p>The Psalms also provide important boundaries; they cause us to deal with God as he is—as he has revealed himself to us in his Word—not as we wish he was. The Psalms are prayers and songs, but they are God’s own words. The Psalms help us learn more about God and how we can address and trust him in a vast array of circumstances.</p><p><em>Be sure to check out the “How to Pray” section for more helpful tips on how to pray the Psalms.</em></p>",

Like anything else in life, however, prayer will not become a priority in our lives on its own. We order our calendars and schedules, giving preference to those things which we deem most important. If time with God in prayer is not given a place of priority in your life, it’s safe to say prayer is not viewed as a priority.</p><p>Our schedules reveal what our hearts treasure most. John Bunyan wrote, “You can do more than pray after you have prayed, but you cannot do more than pray until you have prayed.” In other words, you <em>always</em> have time to pray—but something else may be in its rightful place. Prayer is not merely a “checklist” item or a blocked-out time on the calendar, but taking a good look at your schedule and task lists can help you discern what items have been given a place of priority that they may not deserve.</p><p>Begin your day with Jesus—and watch what a difference it makes!</p>",

Children are a blessing from the Lord, but God never intended them to be placed above him. Our children—wonderful, good gifts—can become idols if we place them above God. Or maybe it’s a job. Maybe God has placed you in an excellent company with a wonderful work environment doing what you love, and you devote your time and energy there above time spent with God. Vocation can be a good, God-glorifying thing, but it can also become an idol.</p><p>As you examine the way your time is spent, don’t simply look for “bad” things; look for <em>good</em> things that have taken the place of the <em>best</em> thing: time with God.</p>",

Jesus told his disciples, “when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret.” This doesn’t necessarily mean that you should have a secret, designated closet or room in your house that is only to be used for prayer. But it does help us understand an important truth: pray in a quiet, private place.</p>",

Bring that list with you into your prayer time to help you stay on track, praying intentionally over each and every person or item on that list.</p>",

Maybe it’s lighting a candle or diffusing your favorite essential oil. Whatever it is for you, create a comfortable, distraction-free environment that is conducive to calm and focus your mind on prayer.</p><p>We understand that finding quiet places of solitude can be difficult during various seasons of life. Whether it’s working long hours, raising small children, or whatever it may be, quiet places and times of solitude can seem like an impossible dream. If that sounds like you, be encouraged: your time of prayer doesn’t have to be perfect. Seek space wherever you can find it. The Lord hears the cries of our hearts even when they’re lifted to him while the kids are eating breakfast, as you drift to sleep after working a 12-hour shift, or while you’re driving in the car. Jesus doesn’t want perfection—he wants <em>you</em>.</p>",

It is a recognition of who God is. In your own time of prayer, this might look like praising God for his kindness and mercy towards you or for giving you a new day. It might simply be telling God that you love him! Adoration to God can be expressed in many different ways, but one thing remains the same: God is the focus. We pray not to or though anyone else, but to God alone (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).</p>",
