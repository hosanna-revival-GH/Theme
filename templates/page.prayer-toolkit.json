        "text": "<p>Prayer is a unique privilege for those who have trusted in Jesus. Apart from Jesus, we could never hope to stand before the throne of a holy God, because we are “strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in this world” (Ephesians 2:12). In other words, without Jesus, we have no hope of any access to a perfect and holy God. But to those who love Jesus and follow him, we are covered in his righteousness—we bear his name. When we pray in the name of Jesus, we have every access to God. Every wall has been torn down and every barrier has been removed—we get to enter boldly into the holy place of the presence of God (Hebrews 10:19, 4:16)—like a child, completely unafraid to approach their dad.</p>",

Prayer is a divine, supernatural act in which all three members of the Trinity are involved to allow us to communicate directly with God.</p><p>Prayer is knowing that God’s ear is listening to every heart-cry of his children because Jesus’ work on the cross has made a way for us to come boldly before him, with the Holy Spirit’s breath helping us communicate directly with God—even when we don’t know what to pray.</p>",
