While earning her degree in English (with a focus on creative writing), she was active in various campus ministries, worked with other college students, and led and taught Bible studies, devotionals, and women’s retreats. Brooke’s career has given her opportunities to utilize a Christ-centered lens to train faith communities on the intersection of faith and justice.</p>",
