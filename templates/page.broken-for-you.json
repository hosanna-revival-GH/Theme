We’re all dressed to impress—little suits and frilly dresses, tights, and shiny patent leather shoes. They are smiling ear to ear while I scowl at the camera, arms tightly crossed. I can’t tell you what I was mad about at that exact moment, but I know that spending hours in itchy clothes and sitting on uncomfortable pews for the longest service of the year was not my jam. Back then, I did not understand why this Sunday was such a big deal compared to all the others. Decades later, I have learned to see Easter a lot differently.”</p>",

Jesus’s death and resurrection are the moment of redemption. And while that is something we mostly rejoice in, the week leading up to the resurrection was not wholly celebratory. Instead, it was full of sorrow, pain, and rejection. It was a week in which Jesus was abandoned by his friends, ridiculed and mocked by the religious and those in power, and ultimately condemned to die. In that week, Jesus was broken. Yet it is only in his brokenness that our salvation is realized.”</p><p><em>— Brooke Jackson</em></p>",

        "text": "<p>Brooke Jackson has been a public defender since 2006, advocating for children and teenagers in Ohio’s legal system and representing them in state and federal court. She came to her work as she was being drawn into God’s heart for those who are vulnerable and in need. Brooke has been a follower of Jesus since she was a teenager. While earning her degree in English (with a focus on creative writing), she was active in various campus ministries, worked with other college students, and led and taught Bible studies, devotionals, and women’s retreats. Brooke’s career has given her opportunities to utilize a Christ-centered lens to train faith communities on the intersection of faith and justice.</p>",
