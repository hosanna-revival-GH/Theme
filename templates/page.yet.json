You can find her yelling <em>Roll Tide! </em>at a television, enjoying a long run, or writing - probably wrapped in a fuzzy blanket. An alumna of the Fulbright Program, she loves traveling and seeing the consistency of God and His love for people throughout the world. <em>YET; The Promise in Habakkuk for Those in Transition</em>, is her first published devotional.</p>",

              "text": "<p>When Erica moved home from Bulgaria after a year of living and teaching in a small city, she experienced a season of transition that left her exhausted, hopeful, crying, and wondering if God was the same in Cincinnati as He was in Silistra. Through Scripture, she found that when the earth shakes and her legs quiver, God is the same: consistent, loving, and actively present. She is overjoyed for readers to find the same God in a season where the world, and their lives, may not feel consistent. </p>",
